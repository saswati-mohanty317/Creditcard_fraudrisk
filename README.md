# Creditcard Fraud Analysis with Cost Minimization using R (Statistical inference of Kmeans,Logistic regression, Classisification trees, Baging & Boosting, Naive Bayes)
I have lead a team project working on a highly imbalanced dataset to correctly identifying credit card fraud transactions from transactions made by  credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders( transactions that  occurred in two days)where we have:
492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. 
The best model was chosen considering the Recall of models and the Minimum Cost Matrix achievable ( using three different Cost matrix).
